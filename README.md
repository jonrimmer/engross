# Engross #

Attempt to make a reasonably non-terrible minimalist/distraction-free/immersive writing app for the web.

This is very alpha, don't use it for anything serious. Only tested in Chrome dev so far, results in other browsers will vary. Use the toolbar on the left to toggle light/dark and fullscreen.
